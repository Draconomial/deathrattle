# Death Rattle

This mod has a rich history. It started [here](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=34469.0) on the Ludeon Forums in 2018. It was created and maintained by Linq until 1.0, then updated by [deathrat](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2013400235) (1.1), [Troopersmith1](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2206107940) (1.2, 1.3), and finally me (1.4, steam link pending).
